# My dotfiles
## Setup
1. Clone as .config
2. Add `ZDOTDIR=~/.config` to `~/.zshenv` so that zsh will source it properly

## Neovim
This contains my complete Neovim config. It is partially based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).
It also contains some features that only work on the nightly version of neovim (10.0.0) at the time of writing this.
Though the config should work pretty much in its entirety on v0.9 as well.
